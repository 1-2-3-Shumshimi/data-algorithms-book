Getting JARs for the "lib" Directory
====================================
GitHub does not let to push large files (size of bigger than 100MB) to GIT repository. 
I have one jar, which is larger than 100 MB, therefore, you should copy the jars for the "lib"
directory from this URL: http://mapreduce4hackers.com/dataalgorithmsbook/lib/

Thanks,

best regards,
