Getting JARs for the "lib" Directory
====================================
GitHub does not let to push large files (size of bigger than 100MB) to GIT repository. 
I have one jar, which is larger than 100 MB, therefore, you should copy the jars for the "lib"
directory from this URL: 

    http://www.mapreduce4hackers.com/dataalgorithmsbook/lib/spark-assembly-1.0.2-hadoop2.5.0.jar


Thanks,

best regards,
