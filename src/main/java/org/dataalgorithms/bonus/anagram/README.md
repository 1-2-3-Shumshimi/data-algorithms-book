What is an Anagram?
===================
Anagram is a word or phrase made by transposing the letters of another 
word or phrase.  An anagram is a type of word play, the result of rearranging 
the letters of a word or phrase to produce a new word or phrase, using all 
the original letters exactly once; for example, the word "anagram" can be 
rearranged into "nagaram". Someone who creates anagrams may be called an 
"anagrammatist".

Programs

The purpose of these MapReduce programs  (Hadoop and Spark) is to find anagrams 
for a set of given  documents.

We will ignore words if their length is less than N (we read N as a parameter).
