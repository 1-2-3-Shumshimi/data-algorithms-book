Before you build, you should read [README_lib.md](../README_lib.md)

Here I am assuming that your install directory is ````<install-dir-data-algorithms-book>/```` and you are executing build instructions from this directory:

[Apache's ant 1.9.4](http://ant.apache.org/) is used for building the project.

* To clean up:

  **ant clean**

* To build: the build will create ````<install-dir-data-algorithms-book>/dist/data_algorithms_book.jar```` file.

  **ant**

* To check your build environment:

  **ant  myenv**
